        <div class="ingredients">
            <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
                <li>maple syrup</li>                
                <li>berries, optional</li>

        <h2>Method</h2>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li class='steps'><strong>WHISK</strong> flour with sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk buttermilk with butter, eggs and vanilla in a medium bowl. Scrape buttermilk mixture into flour mixture. Whisk until batter is just combined. It will be lumpy.</li>

                <li class='steps'><strong>HEAT</strong> a large non-stick frying pan over medium. Spray with oil. Pour 1/3 cup batter into pan. If the pan is big enough, add more 1/3-cup portions of batter. Cook until bubbles form on top of each pancake and edges begin to brown, 2 to 4 min. Using a wide spatula, flip and continue cooking until the bottoms of pancakes are golden, 2 to 3 min. Donâ€™t press or they will become tough. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve with berries and maple syrup.</li>
